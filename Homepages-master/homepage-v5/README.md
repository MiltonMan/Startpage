#Homepage-v5

This version of my main homepage has had some major overhauls in not only look but in function as well. Things are much more material-esque.

##IMPORTANT
Check out the script file in the JS directory. It's where you can setup your links, and change a few extra settings. Further explaination is provided in there.
By default the links, are random sites I used for testing. Feel free to change them however you like!
